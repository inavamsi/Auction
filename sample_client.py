The client will receive the following initial states from server.
    'artists_num': number of artists
    'required_count': number of items for artist to win
    'auction_items': list of auction items
    'player_count': number of players in the auction
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Then for each round, you will receive the game_state and current wealth,
game_state: 'finished': whether the game has finished
            'bid_item': auction item in last round
            'bid_winner': winner in last round (player_name(str))
            'winning_bid': winning bid in last round
            'remain_time': the time you have left
-------------------------------------------------------------------
You should return a whole number as the bid per turn.
